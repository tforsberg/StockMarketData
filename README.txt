Project: StockMarketData

Info and Disclaimer:

strategies and is for personal use only.  Data collected from these scripts
cannot be used in any commercial way.

This intended for the "Programmer who is also interested in the Stock Market"

Please use and contribute to this project.  The more we contribute the better

PS: The initial release of this may have many things that very specific to my 
configuration.  I am a long time programmer, but very new to Python.   I welcome
all suggestions for improvment.
